***Targeting & Triggering***

Use any of our built-in segments or set up your own targeting rules using our extensive array of targeting options. Target your popup campaigns based on various criteria: the pages your visitors have or have not visited, the page they’re currently on, the amount of time they've spent on your site, the products in their carts, their country of origin, or whether they are already subscribers.

Monitor the behavior of every single visitor and trigger your message at the exact moment they take a specific action. Capture the attention of visitors about to leave your site with exit-intent technology. Additionally, trigger your popups based on time spent on a page, scrolling, clicking, or after a custom JavaScript event.

***Analytics tailored to your key goals***

Effortlessly track your campaign's impact with our intuitive Campaign Analytics reports. These provide comprehensive insights at the campaign level, empowering you to continually refine and enhance your strategies.

Our advanced analytics system offers a detailed view of your campaigns' revenue contributions. With OptiMonk’s Conversion Goals, extend your tracking capabilities beyond mere sign-ups and button clicks. Choose the right conversion goals that resonate with your specific business objectives and measure performance using precise metrics tailored to your needs.

🚀 Utilize **Conversion Goals** to:

- Monitor product sales
- Set goals for sales exceeding specific cart values
- Track the volume of products added to carts
